            <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    As a computer science enthusiast, I come from a diverse background, born and bred in India. My educational journey led me to a bachelor's degree in computer science, which served as a strong foundation for my career.
                    I furthered my expertise during a two-year tenure at Infosys, where I focused on the intricacies of DevOps and CI/CD, actively contributing to the enhancement of software development and deployment procedures. <br>  
                    <br>Eager to further my education and explore new horizons, I had the privilege of pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.
                    This academic pursuit allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills in the field, expanding my expertise and broadening my horizons.
